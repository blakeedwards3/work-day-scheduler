# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this project I was giving the starter code for a work day scheduler. I was tasked with adding these to the webpage.

- Time blocks for a standard 9-5 work day
- Color coding functionality to each time block based on what time of day it currently is
- Adding data entered within a time block to local storage
- Making sure the data added to a time block stays on the page after refreshing
